# Welcome to my Github Site!

## Currently home to the Shad0w Synd1cate website.  
### Security Note:  
The Shad0w Synd1cate site uses jQuery, which can have cross-site vulnerability issues like attaching unsanitized user input to the DOM.  
This is not currently a concern, but it may become one if this site is updated to accept user input.

## This repository usually serves as a portfolio page and project showcase.  

However, don't be surprised if experiments, playgrounds, and works-in-progress show up here, because this is MY damned site and I shall do with it as I please.  

Once I permanently host a portfolio site, I'll let you know about it here.  

### In the meantime, go to [bgroveben.github.io](https://bgroveben.github.io) to see what's on display.
