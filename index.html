    <h3>This is but a simple website for now.</h3>
    <p>The content varies depending on my whims as well as how much free time I have for my computer geekery.</p>
    <p>If what you see here bores you, then it probably bores me too, so it will be changed in due time.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, cat pictures and clickbait await you, so off you go to explore the interwebs!</p>
